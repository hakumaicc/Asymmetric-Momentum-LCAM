##We integrated two versions of demo. One is based on jupyter notebook(begin with nb_*, end with *.ipynb), another is traditional python(begin with py_*, end with *.py).

#You can choose to run any version of demo, but:
#Each ipynb files include 6 Training parts, you can run or stop any part you want, and finally can run nb_Tensorboard.ipynb or py_pltResult.py for results.
#Each py files include 4 Training parts for each figure, you have to run thought all 4 Training parts until it is finished, and finally can run nb_Tensorboard.ipynb or py_pltResult.py for results.
